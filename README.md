I am Learning everything as a beginner I need to know to get started building a MongoDB-based app from MongoDB University.

In this course we will go over basic installation, JSON, schema design, querying, insertion of data, indexing and working with language drivers. We will also cover working in sharded and replicated environments. In the course, we will build a blogging platform, backed by MongoDB with Python. 


Coming Soon....
